This code presents implementation of algorithm which calculate n-th order derivative. There is used finite difference coefficients to calculate derivative from discrete data.
Main goal to achive was creating a tool which shows factors, indexes of points used to calculate derivative.

I also implemented ImageJ plugin which used this algorithm to sherpen images or stacks of images. https://github.com/danielpajak/Nth_Order_Derivative

Both implementations are part of my thesis.
